            Family road trips are like mini getaways. 
            My dad always takes charge of planning our adventures. 
            One memorable trip was to the Smoky Mountains when I was just seven years old. <br>
            My mom prepared these amazing meals that she stored in small containers, <br> and we enjoyed them in the car and later in our cozy wood cabin. <br>
            It was a much-needed break for my parents, and our breathing <br> seemed to sync with the rhythm of the rolling mountains, ridge upon ridge. <br>
            I thought it might be the last time we'd visit a national park before heading back home. <br>
            Little did I know that it was just the beginning of a new family tradition.<br>
            
            In my home country, every summer, we embark on a long car journey to the steppe. <br>
            The drive typically spans one or two full days, <br> much like our later visits to various national parks in the United States.<br>
             What we cherished most was not just the destination but the journey itself. <br>
             We spent a significant amount of time on the road, <br>
             but those moments made us feel incredibly alive and free.
